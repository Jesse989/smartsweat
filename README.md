## Inspiration

Have you ever embarked on a fitness journey, filled with motivation and determination, only to be held back by confusion over the correct way to perform an exercise? The fear of injury looms large, yet the guidance we crave seems just out of reach without a personal trainer by our side. Imagine a world where your workout companion is not only a source of encouragement but an expert on form, providing feedback to guide you through each motion with precision. This isn't a dream—it's the reality we've created with Smart Sweat AI.

## What it does

Have you ever struggled to maintain form during a home workout, unsure if your squat depth or back alignment was quite, right? Smart Sweat AI emerges as your personal digital trainer, leveraging the eye of artificial intelligence through your phone's camera. It watches, analyzes, and corrects your form in real time, turning each session into an optimized, personal training experience. What if you could receive instant feedback on your exercise form, tailored specifically to you? Picture yourself performing a squat, and you're slightly off balance.

SmartSweat AI recognizes this, immediately offering adjustments to help refine your stance and protect your posture. It's like having a fitness expert in your pocket, ready to support your journey towards safer, more effective workouts. Have you ever wished for a tool that not only tracks your progress but also ensures you're making the most out of each movement? SmartSweat AI does just that. With a comprehensive library at your fingertips and personalized progress tracking, the app serves as your roadmap to fitness success—ensuring each step you take is in the right direction. This technology isn't just about correcting form; it's a movement towards making quality fitness instruction accessible to everyone. By tapping into the potential of AI, we're breaking down barriers, transforming exercise from a source of uncertainty to a wellspring of empowerment.

## How we built it

We structured our development process into five key areas: Project Management, AI and System Architecture, Application Development, UX/UI Design, and Collaboration and Integration. Each phase was carefully planned, from system architecture design and AI integration to user interface design and final product adjustments.

## Challenges we ran into

Not enough time!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We’re proud of the quality of the UI and the design and about having the opportunity to combine multiple large language models into a multi-agent workflow using many groq agents wielding tools like the Twelve Labs generate tool.

## What we learned

This project deepened our understanding of AI's potential in fitness technology and especially the power of video models. We also learned the importance of a flexible project management approach to adapt to unexpected challenges and incorporate user feedback continuously.

## What's next for Smart Sweat AI

Moving forward, we plan to expand our app’s capabilities with more personalized features, enhance user engagement through gamification, and explore partnerships with health professionals to enrich our app’s wellness recommendations.
